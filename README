This is a shared library designed to give FontForge (and others) access to
Raph Levien's spiro splines. 

You may (possibly) be able to obtain more recent versions of Spiro from
    http://levien.com/garden/ppedit/
use the get-spiro-src.sh script to do so.

To build, type
    ./configure
    make
    make install

Currently I extract very little from spiro, just the bare minimum to convert
a series of (marked) points to a set of cubic bezier curves which ff can use.
